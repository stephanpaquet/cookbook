# Laravel 10.4 Released
https://laravel-news.com/laravel-10-4-0

The Laravel team released 10.4 with a File::json() method, converting existing HasMany relationships to a HasOne relationship, a new test response assertion, and more.

## File::json() method
Austin White contributed a File::json() method as a convenience for getting JSON encoded data from a file:

```php
// Before
$contents = File::get('sample.json');
$data = json_decode($contents, true);
```

```php
// After
$data = File::json('sample.json');
```

```php
dump(Process::run('ls -lah')->output());
$result = Process::run("php -v");

dd($result->output());
```
